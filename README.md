<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm  Siddarth Dayasagar 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">🚀 Robotics Engineer | 🤖 ROS Enthusiast | ⚙️ Enthusiastic learner and awesome team player</h3>

<!-- Intro Section -->
I am a dedicated robotics engineer focusing on developing intelligent systems for autonomous robots. With expertise in ROS1 and ROS2, computer vision, and motion planning, I bring a well-rounded approach to robotic system design and implementation. Currently, I am pursuing my Master’s in Robotics at Northeastern University.

In previous roles as a Robotics Intern at Flomobility and Strider Robotics, I gained extensive experience in building production-level robotic systems, contributing to real-world, scalable solutions. These opportunities enhanced my understanding of end-to-end robotics development, from concept through deployment. 
If you seek a skilled and collaborative robotics engineer to contribute to innovative projects, feel free to connect with me!

<!-- Featured Projects Section -->
### 🚀 Featured Projects
Here are some of my exciting projects in robotics and automation:

  - 🤖 **[DITTO: A OUTDOOR DELIVERY ROBOT](https://github.com/siddarth09/Ditto)**: Ditto is a level 2 autonomous delivery robot that uses a QR code-based authentication fail-proof  locking system and an onboard OAK-D lite camera for perception. This robot can be used in gated communities and huge colleges or universities.
    - Tech: ROS1 Noetic, OAK-D lite depth camera, Rack and pinion-based package securing system. 
    - Video Repo: [Ditto working in realtime](https://youtu.be/vQAGHTjxhpw)

- 🚗 **[RUSTY](https://github.com/siddarth09/Rusty)**: Rusty, is a "picking assist AMR", the robots travel to pick locations, where operators deliver goods based on the robot’s needs. This consists of ROS navigation stack which uses Lidar for both 
    - Tech: ROS1, ROSnav_stack, C++, Python
    - GitHub Repo: [RUSTY](https://siddarth09.github.io/Rusty/)

- 🛒  **S-MART**: Amazon fresh dash cart emulator with custom trained AI-model (yolov4) with 12 different retail products, which enables the user to do self hassle-free checkout.
