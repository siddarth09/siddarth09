<h1 align="center">Hi there, I'm  Siddarth Dayasagar 👋</h1>
<h3 align="center">🚀 Robotics Engineer | 🤖 ROS Enthusiast | ⚙️ Enthusiastic learner and awesome team player</h3>

<!-- Intro Section -->
I'm a passionate robotics engineer specializing in developing intelligent systems for autonomous robots. I have experience in various areas, including ROS1 and ROS2, computer vision, motion planning. I am currently enrolled @Northeastern University for my master's in robotics. 
Previously I worked with companies like @Flomobility and @StriderRobotics as a robotics intern, and gained a lot of exposure in building production level robots. If you are someone looking for a talented, and an amazing co-worker to build robots. Please reach out to me !

<!-- Featured Projects Section -->
### 🚀 Featured Projects
Here are some of my exciting projects in robotics and automation:

  - 🤖 **[DITTO:A OUTDOOR DELIVERY ROBOT](https://github.com/siddarth09/Ditto)**: Ditto is a level 2 autonomous delivery robot that uses a QR code-based authentication fail proof  locking system and an onboard OAK-D lite camera for perception. This robot can be used in gated communities and huge colleges or universities.
    - Tech: ROS1 Noetic, OAK-D lite depth camera, Rack and pinion based package securing system. 
    - Video Repo: [Ditto working in realtime](https://youtu.be/vQAGHTjxhpw)

- 🚗 **[RUSTY](https://github.com/siddarth09/Rusty)**: Rusty, is a "picking assist AMR", the robots travel to pick locations, where operators deliver goods based on the robot’s needs. This consits of ros navigation stack which uses Lidar for both 
    - Tech: ROS1, ROSnav_stack, C++, Python
    - GitHub Repo: [RUSTY](https://siddarth09.github.io/Rusty/)

- 🛒  **S-MART**: Amazon fresh dash cart emulator with custom trained AI-model (yolov4) with 12 different retail products, which enables the user to do self hassle-free checkout.
  - Tech: Python, Computer vision, Raspberry PI 4B+
  - GitHub Repo: [S-MART: Tech cart demo video(https://youtu.be/exugYHKRfuw))
